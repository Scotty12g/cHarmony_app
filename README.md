# cHarmony_app

cHarmony is a project produced as part of an Insight Data Science fellowship in Boston, MA. During the project, I designed and built an image data pipeline in python utilizing segmentation, K-NN, and color theory to discriminate and classify matching items in a userâ€™s wardrobe. The pipeline is optimized over customized validation metrics.

Find the pipeline as a web app (deployed with flask and HTML) here:
